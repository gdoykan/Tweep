# Tweep
This currently does a crude sentiment analysis on a query specified by the user using tweepy <br />
Just messing around with twitter api, maybe will try a more complex/specific analysis
### Usage
Clone and change to the correct directory in terminal<br />
Type your desired query as an arguement when running the python file<br />
For example typing `Python app.py @realDonaldTrump` <br /> in terminal will do a sentiment analysis on recent tweets that mentions @realDonaldTrump<br />
<br />Sentiment is calculated by counting the number of positive and negative words <br />
The range is from -1 to 1 where -1 is the most negative score and 1 is the most positive score
